Really Simple(TM) Slideshow
===========================

Yet another slideshow plugin for jQuery! This particular one loads images dynamically, as and when they're required by the slideshow, allowing you to create larger slideshows without having to pre-load all of the images.

Include rsf-slideshow-1.0.js in your document, then initialise a slideshow like this:

$('#my-slidshow-div').rsfSlideshow();

Please see docs for information about adding slides, and the correct HTML markup.

-------------------------
* Added the controls option.
* Changed the name of the eventCallbacks option to eventHandlers.
* Changed the behaviour of the following methods: bindPlayPause, bindPreviousSlide, bindNextSlide and bindIndex so that they require jQuery objects to bind the behaviours to.

* Changed the name of the plugin file to jquery.rs.slideshow.js to bring it into line with jQuery plugin naming convention.
* Bug fix: More consistent behaviour across browsers when loading cached images into a slideshow.
